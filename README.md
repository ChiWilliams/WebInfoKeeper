# WebInfoKeeper

WebInfoKeeper is a lightweight firefox extension to help store and keep track of texts with minimal friction. To store a value: select a set of text and press `Alt+C`. This will prompt you for a future access label.\
Later, when you want to access the information, press `Alt+G`, input your key, and the value will be added onto your clipboard to paste where you would like.


## Installation

Installation is done through the [Mozilla Addons Distribution Platform](addons.mozilla.com) at [WebInfoKeeper](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/webinfokeeper/)
